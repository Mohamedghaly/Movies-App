# Movies APP
Movies APP is an iOS app that uses the TMBD API to display a list of Movies and their Actors. You can browse through Movies and see them actors.

This app is created as a personal project to showcase my skills and passion for iOS development. This app demonstrates how to implement Clean Architecture and some of the best practices for iOS app development using UIKIt, Combine, MVVM-C and more.
